Hello there, my name is Nicolae Davidov and I'm a third year student at **University of Sussex** studying **(BSc) Games and Multimedia Environment**. I've created a few projects along the way in my university life (some alright some awful). Currently I'm working on my **dissertation** which is a ARPG/Hack and Slash game in **Unity**.

Here are some pictures:
