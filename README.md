# The-Blood-Calls
by Nicolae Davidov

Hello there, my name is Nicolae Davidov and I'm a third year student at **University of Sussex** studying **(BSc) Games and Multimedia Environment**. I've created a few projects along the way in my university life (some alright some awful). Currently I'm working on my **dissertation** which is a fast paced ARPG/Hack and Slash game in **Unity**.

## Story
You will be playing as the main character Goraan, his is on a hunting trip and has't been home in a few days. Your task is to find him, search every village and cave to bring him back home.

## Development

This game is still in it's **early stages**, there will be much more content added such as:
1. Shop keeper & currency
2. Ability powers
3. Spawn points
4. Many different weapons
5. Lots of enemies
