by Nicolae Davidov

Hello there, my name is Nicolae Davidov and I'm a graduate **(BSc) Games and Multimedia Environment** with 2.1 at **University of Sussex**. I've created a few projects along the way in my university life. This project is my **dissertation** which is a fast paced ARPG/Hack and Slash game in **Unity**.

## Story
